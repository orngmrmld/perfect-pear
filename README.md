## User Story
As a person who enjoys food and movies
I want to have an app that suggests a dinner & movie combination in my area
So that I can save time deciding on what movie to watch & dinner to eat.

## Acceptance Criteria
* Application uses at least two server-side APIs (GoogleMaps, OMBD)
* Application uses client-side storage to store persistent data. (User zip code info)
* Application doesn’t use JS alerts, prompts, or confirms (uses modals instead).
* Application uses a CSS framework other than Bootstrap. (Bulma.css)
* Application is interactive (accepts and responds to user input) (User can input zipcode and hit submit button)
